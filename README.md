# globie-daily-briefing

Globie bothers us about things every weekday before we arrive [late] to the office

- APPARENTLY @mixcas says we alway have to say this so:
````
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```
- then u just do the other stuff

## Â¿RTFM?!

Also u need a ton of variables, add them in `.env`. Soon to be even more!

- TRELLO_KEY
- TRELLO_TOKEN
- FORECASTIO_KEY
- LATITUDE
- LONGITUDE
- MAILGUN_KEY
- GITHUB_USER
- GITHUB_PASSWORD

Uses: Trello, Forcast.io, Mailgun, Github, CPUs, Globie

####todo:

- Create dev mode for class that logs and does not mail
- Make language conditional localize all text in mail
- Use futures/solve the async issue
